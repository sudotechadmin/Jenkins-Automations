1) Quick overview (the short story)

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for CI/CD — it runs jobs (freestyle or pipelines), 
Can use agents/nodes to run builds, stores configuration in JENKINS_HOME, and supports “Pipeline as code” using a Jenkinsfile.

2) How to install (two fast, common ways)

A —Run Jenkins quickly with Docker (recommended for learning):

  # create persistent volume
  docker volume create jenkins_home

  # run Jenkins LTS (HTTP 8080, agent 50000)
  docker run -d --name jenkins \
  -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts

  #To get the initial admin password (needed for setup wizard):
  docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

B — Install on Ubuntu / Debian (systemd):
(Install Java first, add Jenkins repo, then install.)
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk   # or java 11/17 depending on Jenkins requirements

# add Jenkins repo + key (follow official instructions)
  $ curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg > /dev/null
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins.gpg] https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install -y jenkins
  $ sudo systemctl enable --now jenkins
# initial password for apt install:
  $ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

3) First run: setup wizard (what to do)

Open http://<server-ip>:8080.

Enter the initial admin password (from the file above).

Choose 'Install suggested plugins' (recommended for learning) or select them manually.

Create your first admin user?
